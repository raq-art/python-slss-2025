## `in` keyword --> `Str`

If you want to see if a string contains some characters
or if it contains a **substring** we can use the `in`
keyword. 

```python
# Ask the customer if they want fries
fries = input ("Do you want fries?")
# "Yes!"
if "yes" in fries_reply:
	print("Here are your fries.")
else:
	print("OK. You will not have fries.")

```
