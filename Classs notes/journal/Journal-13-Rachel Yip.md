## Classes and Objects

\> Imagine we're describing a tree. What properties would you use to describe a tree? (This is similar to the exercise that we did in class yesterday, finding ways to use properties to describe Pokemon.) You can use bullet points.

- has roots
- brown
- different species
- different sizes
- different colour
